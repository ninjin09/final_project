The series is tied at 1‚Äì1 going into Saturday's Game 3 at Cleveland.Early on, it looked like the Cavs might win a playoff game withoutDonovan Mitchellscoring the majority of their points. After averaging 39 points over Cleveland's past three playoff games, Mitchell had only six points at halftime. But he took over in the second half, scoring 16 in the third quarter and 29 for the game.Cleveland took control in the second half, outscoring the Celtics 64‚Äì40. With approximately five minutes remaining in the game, Boston head coach Joe Mazzulla conceded and put most of his bench on the court while the home fans headed for the exits.The Cavs fell behind by nine points in the first quarter, but roared back with an 11‚Äì0 run fueled byEvan Mobley's 11 points with help fromCaris LeVert's six off the bench.

LeVert provided a boost while Mitchell and Garland tried to warm up, adding 21 points and six rebounds. Garland added 14 points, andIsaac OkoroandMax Struseach scored 12.Tatum scored 25 points in total for the Celtics, but shot 7-for-17 from the field.

The Suns ‚Äî who won 49 regular-season games with league‚Äôs third-highest payroll and tax ‚Äî were swept in opening-round series to Timberwolves. Mike Budenholzer will be prominent part of search.pic.twitter.com/SDTRkXxkrG‚Äî Adrian Wojnarowski (@wojespn)May 9, 2024The ouster culminated a disappointing season that saw a Suns roster that addedKevin DurantandBradley Bealin the last two seasons finish sixth in the Western Conference before failing to secure a playoff victory. Vogel is done in Phoenix after a single season produced a 49-33 record.The Suns sacrificed depth in reconstructing their roster around All-NBA guardDevin Booker. Theytraded away key playersincludingMikal Bridgesand Cam Johnson to theBrooklyn Netsin addition to four first-round picks in order to acquire Durant during the 2022-23 season. Theydealt Chris Paul and Landry Shamet last offseasonto acquire Bradley Beal from theWashington Wizards.The deals depleted the Phoenix bench and left the Suns without a true point guard in the rotation. Instead, Booker and Beal ‚Äî both primarily scoring guards ‚Äî split time running the Suns offense.The Suns also lack size up front outside of starting centerJusuf Nurkiƒá. That lack of size was exposed against the bigger Timberwolves, who feature multi-time All-StarsRudy GobertandKarl-Anthony Townsand Sixth Man of the YearNaz Reidon their front line. The Timberwolves secured a 46.3-32.5 advantage in rebounds per game over the Suns in their four-game series.The hope in Phoenix was that the top-heavy roster would lead to the Suns competing for a championship. Instead, it's become clear that it's not built to compete at the top of the Western Conference as constructed.Dismissing Vogel won't solve those roster woes. It does give the Suns a starting point to make adjustments in the offseason.Vogel is back on the job market after 19 seasons on NBA sidelines as an assistant or head coach. He's spent his last 12 NBA seasons as a head coach, including previous stints with theLos Angeles Lakers,Orlando MagicandIndiana Pacers. He coached the Lakers to an NBA championship in the 2019-20 season.The Suns, on the other hand, will now look for a third head coach in as many years.The Suns apparently wasted no time getting their coaching search started.FormerMilwaukee Buckshead coach Mike Budenholzer has emerged as the ""frontrunner"" to replace Vogel in Phoenix, Wojnarowski reported on Thursday afternoon. The report came just hours after the Suns fired Vogel.Budenholzer is the Suns‚Äô target and talks are expected to move quickly, sources tell ESPN. He‚Äôs been working to assemble a coaching staff for a return to a head coaching job and that process is also gathering momentum, sources said.https://t.co/PSWPi9C6Pr‚Äî Adrian Wojnarowski (@wojespn)May 9, 2024Budenholzer was fired by the Bucks last spring after five seasons with the franchise, just two years after he led the team to their second NBA title. It marked his second head coaching job in the league, following a five-year run with theAtlanta Hawks. Budenholzer spent 17 seasons under Gregg Popovich as an assistant with theSan Antonio Spurs, too.Though the 54-year-old didn't coach this past season in the league, he's widely been considered a top candidate for an open job this offseason. He's from northern Arizona, too, which only adds to the fit for him with the Suns.Budenholzer is just being considered a ""frontrunner"" for the job as of Thursday afternoon, and it's still unclear when the Suns will make a decision or who else they are considering for the position.Finch collided with Mike Conley in the final two minutes of Minnesota's series-ending win over the Suns.Durant and Booker combined for 82 points. But Edwards again proved too much for the Suns to overcome.The Phoenix Suns pushed in all their chips to go nowhere.Anthony Edwards dropped 36 points in Phoenix.The Timberwolves are rolling even when their All-Stars struggle.The Phoenix Suns clinched the Western Conference's No. 6 seed in the NBA playoffs with a win over the Minnesota Timberwolves, coupled with the Los Angeles Lakers defeating the New Orleans Pelicans.Jake Fischer and Dan Devine discuss the Knicks taking a 2-0 lead over the Pacers, the Hornets hiring a new head coach and some big questions for the Bucks, 76ers, Clippers & Magic.Jason Fitz, Charles Robinson and Frank Schwab talk about which quarterback rooms concern them and which they find interesting heading into the 2024 NFL season.The No. 1 pick in the 2024 WNBA Draft is set for her preseason finale tonight.Keefe took over from Mike Babcock in November 2019.The 2024 Yankees have rediscovered their bravado and hold the second-best record in the AL, thanks in large part to the superstar outfielder.It‚Äôs unclear if the wager will actually hold up under the league‚Äôs gambling policy.The former Patriots head coach and the team's longtime owner met backstage before the show.The pair has been a perfect fit on the court, but it‚Äôs away from the game where the dynamic duo‚Äôs friendship was really forged.Fantasy baseball analyst Andy Behrens offers up a fresh batch of midweek pickups to consider, led by a former Dodgers prospect.Jamal Murray was fined $100,000 by the league this week for throwing things onto the court in his team's loss to the Timberwolves on Monday.If she can pull off a sixth straight win this week in New Jersey, Nelly Korda will set a new LPGA Tour record.On today's show, Dan Wetzel, Ross Dellenger and SI's Pat Forde talk college athletics revenue sharing, Brian Kelly complaining about not wanting to pay players, which teams are struggling to recruit, the Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl, and a psychedelic commencement speaker.Skenes, the No. 1 pick in the 2023 MLB Draft, began this season in Triple-A.‚ÄúI think it got pretty complicated and pretty messy.‚Äù"

He was driving to the rim for a layup when he awkwardly pulled up at the backboard and started hopping under the basket. The game continued as he struggled near the baseline, and then he quickly limped off the court and directly to the locker room the next time the game was stopped.He didn‚Äôt return, and finished the night with 28 points while shooting 10-of-19 from the field. Anunoby, who was traded to the Knicks by the Raptors ahead of the deadline earlier this year, has averaged 14.1 points and 4.4 rebounds with the Knicks.It‚Äôs unclear how bad Anunoby‚Äôs hamstring injury is, or how long he will be sidelined. The team ruled him out of the game almost immediately on Wednesday, and there‚Äôs only a single day between games for him to rest and recover. Game 4 of the series is set for Sunday, though it‚Äôs unknown if he‚Äôll be ready to go by then.While Anunoby is out, the Knicks listed starJalen Brunsonas questionable for Game 3.Brunson left Wednesday‚Äôs contestin the first quarter and missed all of the second period with a right foot injury. He returned in the second half, however, and ended up dropping 29 points to push the Knicks to a nine-point win.The Knicks hold a 2-0 series lead over the Pacers headed into Game 3. They are eying what would be their first Eastern Conference finals appearance since 2000."

No doubt he was frustrated after two games of some shoddy officiating, some moments those refs would like to have back and a couple of unforgivable calls that went the Knicks‚Äô way.ThePacers sent in several dozen plays to the league officethey considered questionable, which is standard practice for teams following games. It happens all the time, except in this case, the Knicks will be able to see exactly what the Pacers sent in as opposed to it being a bit more clandestine.Carlisle wasn‚Äôt coy about how he felt his team was officiated and the possible motives behind it.‚ÄúI‚Äôm always talking to our guys about not making it about the officials ‚Ä¶ but we deserve a fair shot,‚Äù Carlisle said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not a consistent balance, and that‚Äôs disappointing. Their physicality is rewarded and ours is penalized.‚ÄùAnd then, the coup de gr√¢ce. Carlisle exploded when a double-dribble on Knicks centerIsaiah Hartensteinwas called back, he believes, simply because Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said Hartenstein didn‚Äôt commit the infraction.Now, it didn‚Äôt appear Hartenstein double-dribbled, but never ‚Äî and emphasis on ""never"" ‚Äî do you see a coach get a call like that changed once the whistle blows.‚ÄúThat‚Äôs small beans compared to everything else,‚Äù Carlisle said. ‚ÄúSmall-market teams deserve an equal shot. Deserve a fair shot, no matter where they‚Äôre playing.‚ÄùIf the cause is to get the call right, then Carlisle has a huge point on that micro example. But given what occurred in Game 1, when the Pacers really have a case of being wronged, that logic wasn‚Äôt applied when officials incorrectly called a kick ball on the Pacers whenAaron Nesmithcleanly got his hand on a pass fromJalen Brunsonduring a tied game with 52.1 seconds left.The call couldn‚Äôt be reviewed, and instead of a 4-on-2 fast break for the Pacers, the Knicks received the ball back, thenDonte DiVincenzohit a triple to put the Knicks up, leading to a win.Carlisle is taking a page from the Phil Jackson, Chuck Daly, Pat Riley, brothers Van Gundy playbook and exerting some pressure to a league that is very sensitive about perceived biases toward a team like the Knicks.The aforementioned coaches tweaked the league and worked the officials in days between games, a clear agenda to bring attention to the officiating crews who‚Äôd work the next games. It was part entertainment, part strategy, and we all leaned into it.It‚Äôs fun, and everybody loves a good conspiracy theory, especially when there‚Äôs evidence to back up the claims. The thesis just might not be correct.Carlisle refused to blame the officiating following Game 1, then looked at the high road two days later and went a step away from nuclear.Whether he fully believes it or not, Carlisle and other coaches around the league know who‚Äôs being talked about nationally, what teams receive the bulk of media and television coverage around the league, and it seeps into their minds. And Carlisle, as president of the coaches association, knows he can't levy serious claims to the integrity of the game.The NBA doesn‚Äôt control what ESPN talks about, and consciously, Carlisle is smart enough to know that. TheLakersget the ""A"" block, even when they‚Äôre nowhere near the playoffs.OrlandoandClevelandand Indiana, nobody knows they exist given the television coverage and, yes, sometimes in this space as well.And when you continuously hear on broadcasts, ‚ÄúThe NBA is so much better when the Knicks are relevant,‚Äù it‚Äôs hard to ignore ‚Äî even if you ignore the fact the Knicks have been to a grand total of one Eastern Conference final since 1999.There‚Äôs no denying Madison Square Garden is electric in the springtime, and for the TV visual it looks like an intoxicating environment. The Pacers have a charm, but it‚Äôs always been as a small-market foil to the likes of the Knicks,Bullsand even theMiami HeatwhenLeBron Jameswas there.Good versus not-so-good, famous versus unknown, it‚Äôs a tale as old as time, and it makes for a compelling lead-in.From a pure basketball standpoint, though, it gets more complicated. The Knicks are an undermanned, rough-and-tumble bunch who play physical at every spot on the floor, starting with their bulldog of a point guard, Jalen Brunson.He lowers his shoulder and knocks opposing guards off his body like a bowling ball to pins, and he‚Äôs done that all year ‚Äî like the Knicks have.The Pacers were built like a race car, in the ways the game was officiated in the first half of the season. Small contact was rewarded and physical play was legislated out of the game even more.But in the second half of the year, the pendulum swung and teams like the Knicks could be more handsy ‚Äî and once you establish a style, a physical one, you‚Äôre probably given more leeway by the officials subconsciously.It can be difficult to change officiating patterns midstream in a season, especially when officials are trained and drilled in the offseason and implementing change in the preseason while gradually adjusting.And the games have been better and more compelling than the ticky-tack calls we‚Äôve seen over the last couple years. It‚Äôs a welcome change.However, strange things have happened with the Knicks at Madison Square Garden this season when games were close.PistonsrookieAusar Thompsonwas essentially speared on the sideline by DiVincenzo with the Pistons holding a one-point lead and 6.9 seconds remaining, in full view of the official who was more spectator than someone doing his job.The Knicks scored on that play, won that game and of course, like in Game 1, the officials admitted their mistake in the immediate aftermath but nothing could be done.The two-minute report frustrates everyone because it doesn‚Äôt change what we‚Äôve seen from a million angles the night before, and the last thing anyone wants to see is officials succumb to human error and interrupt competitive, compelling games.Whistles blown, whistles swallowed, it comes in all forms. It‚Äôs not necessarily about free-throw disparity but consistency in calls ‚Äî likeMyles Turner‚Äôs questionable offensive foul on a screen where, yes, DiVincenzo was again in the middle of it. The Knicks' talented swingman appeared to flop and, while Turner wasn‚Äôt completely set, the contact wasn‚Äôt anywhere near egregious ‚Äî especially compared to the previous play where DiVincenzo leaned in on Nesmith and tangled his arms on a screen to free up Brunson.That was the play where Brunson threw an errant pass and it was ruled a Knick-ball, or kickball.DiVincenzo seems to be everywhere, doesn‚Äôt he?But bad calls don‚Äôt have to equal a conspiracy on part of the league office or the officiating crew. Carlisle has the right to pull that lever, even when a fine could be coming, to at least plant the seed in everyone‚Äôs minds what to watch out for as the series changes venues.The Pacers can‚Äôt change who they are, and while the Knicks are steadily running out of bodies, they won‚Äôt change who they are.Human nature can‚Äôt be changed, but you just hope our eyes and our biases aren‚Äôt seeing the same things.Jake Fischer and Dan Devine discuss the Knicks taking a 2-0 lead over the Pacers, the Hornets hiring a new head coach and some big questions for the Bucks, 76ers, Clippers & Magic.Jalen Brunson is considered questionable for Friday‚Äôs game in Indianapolis.The Knicks have been more aggressive utilizing challenges early in games, and they led the league in total challenges and successful challenges during the first round of the NBA playoffs.Tuesday's last-2-minute report should be interesting.The 76ers will reportedly make the argument that they have ""been disadvantaged more than any other team"" in the league when it comes to officiating so far in the playoffs.Beverley has since said about both incidents, ""I have to be better. And I will.""Frank Vogel's out after one season in Phoenix failed to produce a playoff win.The No. 1 pick in the 2024 WNBA Draft is set for her preseason finale tonight.The gambling scandal involving Shohei Ohtani's former interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, who stole $17 million from the superstar to cover betting losses, is in development as a TV series.Jason Fitz, Charles Robinson and Frank Schwab talk about which quarterback rooms concern them and which they find interesting heading into the 2024 NFL season.The 2024 Yankees have rediscovered their bravado and hold the second-best record in the AL, thanks in large part to the superstar outfielder.Keefe took over from Mike Babcock in November 2019.The Charlotte Hornets announced on Thursday morning that it hired Boston Celtics assistant Charles Lee, who will join the team once Boston's playoff run is complete.As modern media becomes more niche driven, teams and even leagues have to balance whether to seek the biggest TV contracts or the biggest potential audience.The pair has been a perfect fit on the court, but it‚Äôs away from the game where the dynamic duo‚Äôs friendship was really forged.Teams have made their big splashes in free agency and made their draft picks, it's time for you to do the same.

8,https://sports.yahoo.com/how-the-deep-bond-between-nikola-jokic-and-aaron-gordon-has-shaped-the-nuggets-155932618.html,How the deep bond between Nikola Jokiƒá and Aaron Gordon has shaped the Nuggets,"One day, afterDenverclimbed the NBA‚Äôs rocky mountaintop to claim the 2022-23 NBA title,Nuggetscoaches and players walked into their Pepsi Center locker room, where an enormous leather saddle waited on the chair that belongs toNikola Jokiƒá. The 7-foot, 280-pound center does have four framed pictures of his prize-winning horses hanging on the glass doors of his locker stall. Yet each beast has a wheeled harness fixed to it. None is mounted by a feather of a rider, let alone by one of the largest basketball players on the planet.‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt imagine Nikola on a horse,‚Äù Nuggets assistant coach David Adelman said. ‚ÄúBut this saddle made me think if there‚Äôs a horse big enough for it,thatwould be the horse.‚ÄùIt was stitched, custom, with the red, blue and white Serbian flag, plus the three-time MVP‚Äôs surname, as if anyone needed help knowingAaron Gordon‚Äôs gift now belonged to the giant genius of the game. Jokiƒá‚Äôs smile flashed wide, his fist flailing childlike,realizing live on TVhe could persuade Denver owner Josh Kroenke to fly him private back to his hometown of Sombor, returning to his stable and neighborhood track in time for a horse race three days after the team‚Äôs championship parade.And so Gordon, the bouncy Nuggets forward, the 28-year-old who dominated Game 1 of their NBA Finals victory and who‚Äôs finished so many of Jokiƒá‚Äôs passes over four seasons together, simply wanted to show his appreciation for a man who‚Äôs quickly become one of his closest confidants. ‚ÄúIt transcends basketball,‚Äù Gordon told Yahoo Sports. ‚ÄúEven if I never play another game again, I‚Äôd hang out with that guy. I‚Äôd run through a wall for him.‚Äù Gordon, to be sure, assists Jokiƒá with his own fancy finds. But he‚Äôs looked for further avenues, further tokens, to show his appreciation. Gordon hopes the saddle becomes a Jokiƒá family heirloom. When Gordon was out old-school car shopping, he gifted Jokiƒá a manual transmission white Ford Bronco.‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt gonna get him a horse, so I got him horsepower,‚Äù Gordon told Yahoo Sports. ‚ÄúI was thinking about, like, quarterbacks getting their lineman cars. So this is basically the other way around.‚ÄùWhen asked if Jokiƒá had taken the wheels for a spin, he laughed as if the answer was obvious, like the matrix of complicated passing lanes he somehow gleans. ‚ÄúI cannot drive it. It‚Äôs too small for me,‚Äù Jokiƒá told Yahoo Sports. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in my house.‚ÄùThrough gifts and European trips, through screens and assists, Denver‚Äôs two frontcourt starters have melded together like the pair of pickaxes on Denver‚Äôs logo. ‚ÄúYou couldn‚Äôt find a better fit for Nikola,‚Äù Nuggets forwardMichael Porter Jr.said. Their synergy serves as a bedrock of the Nuggets‚Äô core, and they will need Jokiƒá‚Äôs and Gordon‚Äôs connective playmaking more than ever to overcome a 2-0 series deficit againstMinnesotain the second round of the playoffs if Denver hopes to hang a consecutive banner. Star guardJamal Murrayhas struggled through the first two contests against theTimberwolves, and he‚Äôs just as critical of a cog within Denver‚Äôs two- and three-man actions the Nuggets typically program around Jokiƒá, Murray and Gordon.One of which often results in the patented play of Denver‚Äôs cohesive offense. You know it, that one-two-three punch where Jokiƒá receives a pocket pass from Murray, like a stone skipping across water, before Jokiƒá, without even looking and the ball having barely grazed his fingertips, flips a perfect toss to Gordon flying along the baseline. Ask any member of the Nuggets‚Äô traveling party, and they can name a different sequence from a different game.The Lakers one, the Celtics one, the Warriors one.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like a twin telepathy,‚Äù Nuggets guardCollin Gillespiesaid.‚ÄúNo-look lobs against a rotating defense is absolutely crazy,‚Äù Adelman said.Sometimes matches are made in the half-court, where players connect on backdoor cuts from their very first pickup run. But Jokiƒá‚Äôs and Gordon‚Äôs wavelength is something beyond, something honed, something refined and sharpened season after season. Gordon has played in 241 of 274 games since arriving in Denver. He can mask any hole in any lineup at 6-foot-8 with a 7-foot-3 wingspan. ‚ÄúWhen Jamal‚Äôs been out, when Mike‚Äôs been out, AG has always kinda been there, been that consistent guy that Jok can kinda count on,‚Äù Gillespie said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs always in a spot where he can find him.‚ÄùThat may be one more argument in favor of continuity, when it comes to the NBA‚Äôs heavily contested pursuit of roster building. Plus there‚Äôs an adjacent commonality threading among the teams still alive in this postseason. Like the gigantic Timberwolves, who have thus far outclassed the Nuggets through two games; like thePacerszipping aroundTyrese Haliburton; like theKnickshustling behindJalen Brunson; like the roaring dogs inOklahoma City, and so on; chemistry and identity are trumping general ability. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just putting together talent. The pieces have to fit and they have to complement one another,‚Äù Denver head coach Michael Malone said. ‚ÄúAnd I think Aaron and Nikola are a terrific complement to one another.‚ÄùIt was Jokiƒá who came to Gordon after the latter‚Äôs trade to Denver in March 2022 and espoused his wisdom about the dunker spot. Gordon had pounded the ball inOrlando, where the No. 4 overall pick in the 2014 NBA Draft always toggled through perimeter positions under different coaches. Gordon has showcased a knack for creating since he was ripping rebounds in high school and barreling into the open floor. Jokiƒá helped convince him of an even craftier impact that was waiting to be mastered at the baseline. And that setup introduced an equal creator for Denver, along a different dimension of the defense. Not to mention Gordon can chew the glass into putback posters, ‚ÄúWhich is f***ing awesome,‚Äù Gordon said while grinning.‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a great finisher. He has a great, big body. He knows how to use his body and good hands. He‚Äôs doing an amazing job for us,‚Äù Jokiƒá told Yahoo Sports. ‚ÄúI think the teams, when they see him in the dunker, somebody needs to cover him, and that‚Äôs a lot more space for everybody else.‚Äù‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt crack back on him, Aaron is a basket creator, man,‚Äù Adelman said.Jokiƒá taught him where and when to dig out position in the post and the optimal timing on screens ‚Äî not to always hold the pick, when to just touch and go. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a savant when it comes to basketball,‚Äù Gordon said of Jokiƒá. By Denver‚Äôs third game with Gordon in the lineup, a seven-point road win against a healthyClipperssquad, Nuggets coaches felt they‚Äôd discovered an alchemy capable of ringing diamonds around their fingers. ‚ÄúWe knew with a guy like Aaron,‚Äù Malone said, ‚Äúwho can guard 1-5, he makes everyone else‚Äôs lives that much easier, both offensive and defensively.‚ÄùMany around the league viewed Denver‚Äôs acquisition of Gordon as a direct means to replaceJerami Grant. The talented forward had fled the Nuggets for thePistonsin 2021 free agency, even though he‚Äôd been offered the same years and same salary to stay with Denver. It marked one of several, mounting blows to Denver‚Äôs trademark continuity. To land Gordon, the Nuggets had to relinquish a cultural standard bearer inGary Harristo the Magic as well. Grant, though, was more of an isolation scorer, dangerous enough to uplift a second unit when Jokiƒá was on the bench. Before Grant, Denver had found something special with veteranPaul Millsapfilling the Nuggets‚Äô gaps with his active hands and own fantastic vision. With Gordon, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost like we got a hybrid,‚Äù Adelman said, ‚Äúand a little bit of both.‚ÄùAdelman overlapped with Gordon for one year in Orlando, where he watched the dunk contest champion work relentlessly on improving his dribble attacks on the basket and how to leverage all his power without overdoing things. In Denver, Gordon stays studying right alongside Jokiƒá. The rapid rate at which he‚Äôs grown to process the game through a symmetrical lens as the all-world center has stunned Nuggets staffers. Gordon is a problem in transition, willing and able to fire cross-court hit-aheads to racing shooters. In the half court, he can show and catch and create on his own ‚Äî or work off Jokiƒá like it‚Äôs second nature.They stand next to each other during national anthems. Whenever the Nuggets hold morning walkthroughs, they‚Äôll often share the same insight, like they‚Äôve found an answer hidden inside a textbook the whole class needs to hear, one step short of finishing each other‚Äôs sentences. When they walk back to the halftime locker room, they‚Äôre often in deep discussion, sometimes with an arm wrapped around a shoulder, contemplating the pieces on the chess board they‚Äôre leaving behind. Gordon‚Äôs locker, where Nike snow goggles still hang from last summer‚Äôs Champagne celebration, is only separated from Jokiƒá‚Äôs dressing area by the locker of two-way centerJay Huff. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm inhibiting their friendship,‚Äù he said.They share so much in common, despite hailing from worlds apart and opposite ends of the 2014 NBA Draft. They both began playing with the ball in their hands and functioning as floor generals before their bodies bloomed and their respective paths grew clouded by proverbial positions. They relish thinking the game two and three steps in advance, perhaps a shared relic from their divergent pasts. Jokiƒá and Gordon are each the youngest of three siblings ‚Äî ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre both baby boys,‚Äù Gordon smiled ‚Äî and able to evaluate the world through the footsteps that came before them, which to follow and which to avoid to leave new imprints in the sand. ‚ÄúI think just having brothers, you share things,‚Äù Jokiƒá told Yahoo Sports. ‚ÄúIt helps you grow up and it helps you become a good man.‚Äù‚ÄúThey are very like-minded in a lot of different ways that work in harmony,‚Äù saidDrew Gordon, Aaron‚Äôs older brother.Drew even played the 2012-13 season for Partizan, the decorated Belgrade club Jokiƒá grew up watching battle against rival Red Star, back when Denver‚Äôs leader was still a teenager and before he was a dot on the NBA‚Äôs scouting radar. Drew Gordon understood the greater magnitude of basketball warfare in Jokiƒá‚Äôs native land. Drew would have to dodge Sprite bottles loaded with loogies, coins torched by lighters and even M-80 fireworks hurled like grenades onto the court during free throws. All that understanding helped Aaron follow Jokiƒá‚Äôs lead in Denver. ‚ÄúI could empathize with him. I knew he was tough,‚Äù Aaron told Yahoo Sports. ‚ÄúIf you go through that, you know, it‚Äôs in the blood. You‚Äôre cut from the cloth.‚ÄùJokiƒá remembered Drew, but held even sharper memories of Aaron from that same summer. His Serbian team fell short against Aaron‚Äôs Team USA, 82-68, in the 2013 FIBA U19 World Championships in Prague. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve known him since that day,‚Äù Jokiƒá said. ‚ÄúThey won gold, and he was MVP of the tournament.‚Äù All Serbia‚Äôs bigs could do was bump Gordon off course as he soared through the lane, averaging 12.6 points and 6.2 rebounds en route to his honors.‚ÄúI got MVP of that tournament,‚Äù Aaron Gordon said, ‚Äúbut he turned around and got MVP of the NBA.‚ÄùTwo summers ago, their first as teammates, Gordon completed their full circle around the basketball globe. He‚Äôs been described by many as an eager traveler, hungering to learn from foreign cultures, once casually texting Adelman a picture of Gordon and former Nuggets guardWill Bartonriding camels outside the pyramids in Egypt. So while Gordon was jetting around, he learned Jokiƒá was back with the Serbian national team in Prague, this time competing in the 2022 Eurobasket, and Gordon surprised his towering teammate by attending Jokiƒá‚Äôs last game of the competition ‚Äî in the very same O2 arena he once defeated him. ‚ÄúFor no reason, he just showed up. It meant a lot,‚Äù Jokiƒá told Yahoo Sports. ‚ÄúOur relationship is growing, it‚Äôs like normal friends, I think.‚ÄùAfter they defeatedMiamifor the title last June, a layover in London from Malaga, Spain, couldn‚Äôt prevent Gordon from making a long pit stop in Serbia before fulfilling sneaker tour obligations in China ‚Äî Gordon helped recruit Jokiƒá to sign with the same Chinese sportswear company, 361 Degrees. Gordon landed first in Belgrade, then met Jokiƒá for a long evening replete with Rakija ‚Äî Serbia‚Äôs national,strongbeverage of choice ‚Äî in Novi Sad, before following him back to Sombor. He watched Jokiƒá ride a bike through the town, seeing his influence on the community as he passed through with each pedal. Jokiƒá constructed an entire compound of homes for his family so they can all live together, something Gordon has always dreamed of building for his own tribe. ‚ÄúHe saw my life and my friends,‚Äù Jokiƒá told Yahoo Sports. ‚ÄúIt was a cool thing to see, to have him there.‚ÄùThey feasted on fish stew. Gordon devoured all kinds of lamb and beef mixed with cheese.‚ÄúI‚Äôm actually gonna ask him after this when can I get some Serbian food,‚Äù Gordon told Yahoo Sports in March. He joined Jokiƒá‚Äôs family on the track after a racing win, lifting the golden trophy above their heads just like it was the Larry O‚ÄôBrien, before most in attendance flocked to the infield and listened to music, guzzling beers like a block party.Gordon now wants to purchase a horse and raise it within Jokiƒá‚Äôs successful stable. ‚ÄúAlmost like an investment,‚Äù Gordon said. ‚ÄúKinda just go with him and see horse auctions and see what he has to say. You know, see his eyes, see his perspective on it.‚Äù Just as he‚Äôs done on the hardwood.Jokiƒá, however, protests he doesn‚Äôt have the same answers in that realm of sport. He‚Äôs merely along for the ride. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just listening, you know? I think that‚Äôs a lottery,‚Äù Jokiƒá told Yahoo Sports of horses. ‚ÄúPeople who say that they know something, they‚Äôre lying.‚ÄùThey will need fortune and fitness and fortitude to overcome the current hurdle before them. Tim Connelly, the former Nuggets executive who drafted Jokiƒá and traded for Gordon, has built a titanic Timberwolves contender, pairingRudy GobertwithKarl-Anthony Townsto support the ascendingAnthony Edwards, almost as if Minnesota‚Äôs been genetically engineered to thwart Denver‚Äôs own impressive frontline. Will the Nuggets regroup? Will their close-knit cohort be enough?‚ÄúThat‚Äôs who I do it for,‚Äù Gordon said. ‚ÄúEvery day when I feel like I‚Äôm tired, and I feel like I don‚Äôt want to work out and I don‚Äôt want to get that extra rep in, I just think of Nikola and I think of Jamal and I think of Michael and [Kentavious Caldwell-Pope] and the guys in this locker room, and I make sure I do it for them. That gives me the energy I need to finish strong.‚ÄùNFL first-round draft pick Terrion Arnold says the Las Vegas Raiders nearly took him with the No. 13 selection but opted for Brock Bowers on a coin flip.

He was surprisingly consistent, failing to hit double-figure scoring just seven times all season, showcasing an ability to get up a high volume of both 3-pointers and free throws, which is usually a steady model for offensive efficiency.While Thomas exploded onto the scene from a scoring standpoint, he didn‚Äôt offer much of anything else, which became a theme for these Nets. Outside of Bridges andNic Claxton, who averaged 11.8 points and 9.9 rebounds and played exceptional defense all year, no other Net who played regular minutes proved to be a consistent two-way threat or all-around player.Dorian Finney-Smithplayed high-caliber defense, but managed just 8.5 points in 28.4 minutes per game.Dennis Schr√∂der, who came over in a deadline deal fromToronto, averaged 14.6 points and 6 assists but failed to stand out defensively.Needless to say, you don‚Äôt win a lot of basketball games if your roster is primarily full of one-end players who can‚Äôt get out of their comfort zone. Their one hope of having a switchable all-around player available to them was Ben Simmons, but he played in just 15 games due to a back injury, leaving his Nets future ‚Äî and even career ‚Äî in limbo.With no draft picks this summer, and Claxton becoming an unrestricted free agent, you have to wonder what the plan inBrooklynis. Because, as of right now, things look bleak.Talent. The Nets are in no position to be picky, and if they hope to pair Bridges with another All-Star, they have to make darn sure that player is capable of lifting the entire roster to new heights. The Nets found themselves far too often coming into games at a talent disadvantage and, should they wish to be competitive, that must change this summer. Bridges, 27, isn‚Äôt getting any younger.The Nets do not have a draft pick this year, but they could buy or trade their way into the second round if a player falls unexpectedly or if the front office feels like there's a missing piece.‚Äî Krysten PeekProjected draft picks (pre-lottery):NoneThe Nets have $115 million locked up in Simmons,Cameron Johnson, Bridges, Finney-Smith and Schr√∂der. They wish to retain Claxton, who carries a cap hold of over $16.6 million ‚Äî and will likely cost more than that ‚Äî meaning with the added contracts of the rest of the roster, the Nets will be over the cap.They will, however, be below the luxury tax line of $171.3 million, meaning they can use their full non-tax mid-level exception, which is worth around $13 million. That type of contract isn‚Äôt going to field them an enormous difference maker, however.Key free agentsNic Claxton (UFA)Lonnie Walker(UFA)Brooklyn likely wants to get better ‚Äî and immediately. If so, that necessitates the removal of Simmons‚Äô $40.3 million contract, which is clogging up its cap sheet. With no picks to offer this year, the Nets will have to dig into their draft cupboard and shop future selections, including the ones they received fromPhiladelphiain theJames Hardentrade, to get off that contract. If they can‚Äôt, it‚Äôs likely they return next season with a similar level of talent on the roster.Considering their limited frontcourt depth, re-signing Claxton makes sense. But the real move the Nets need to make is leaning into more of Thomas, whom I believe has untapped potential as a playmaker. Thomas averaged 4.3 assists in March and is still just 22 years old. While he's been typecast as a chucker, this team desperately needs someone who scores and creates for others, and he could fit the bill if given the opportunity.‚Äî Dan TitusHeat Culture may mean a more cautious approach to retool around Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo.Utah‚Äôs decision to lean into youth this season was puzzling and makes this summer all the more intriguing as to what the next step in the team's plan is.The No. 1 pick in the 2024 WNBA Draft is set for her preseason finale tonight.Jason Fitz, Charles Robinson and Frank Schwab talk about which quarterback rooms concern them and which they find interesting heading into the 2024 NFL season.Jake Fischer and Dan Devine discuss the Knicks taking a 2-0 lead over the Pacers, the Hornets hiring a new head coach and some big questions for the Bucks, 76ers, Clippers & Magic.Jalen Brunson is considered questionable for Friday‚Äôs game in Indianapolis.The gambling scandal involving Shohei Ohtani's former interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, who stole $17 million from the superstar to cover betting losses, is in development as a TV series.Former NBA player Glen Davis was sentenced to 40 months in prison after his conviction for being involved in a scheme to defraud the league's healthcare plan.A disappointing April led Carroll and his Diamondbacks coaches to reexamine his swing mechanics and get back to his strengths.The pair has been a perfect fit on the court, but it‚Äôs away from the game where the dynamic duo‚Äôs friendship was really forged.As modern media becomes more niche driven, teams and even leagues have to balance whether to seek the biggest TV contracts or the biggest potential audience.Keefe took over from Mike Babcock in November 2019.Fantasy baseball analyst Andy Behrens offers up a fresh batch of midweek pickups to consider, led by a former Dodgers prospect.The Nuggets superstar joined exclusive company with his third NBA MVP award, which comes with unfair responsibility.‚ÄúI think it got pretty complicated and pretty messy.‚ÄùKelly said LSU hasn't ""fared very well"" in its attempts to add transfer defensive linemen.McDowell has driven for the team since the start of the 2018 season.The show will begin airing in the fall.If she can pull off a sixth straight win this week in New Jersey, Nelly Korda will set a new LPGA Tour record.Fantasy baseball analyst Fred Zinkie offers up his top buy low/high and sell low-high candidates for Week 6."

The team finished 5-25 over its final 30 games after what was mostly a fairly competitive season. Lauri Markkanen played All-Star-caliber basketball for the second year in a row (23.2 points, 8.2 rebounds),Collin Sextonbounced back from a forgettable season, and Utah‚Äôs three first-round selections all showed signs of life ‚Äî George most of all.Utah‚Äôs late-season collapse did coincide with Markkanen and forwardJohn Collinsboth missing time due to injury, however, the franchise wasn't in position to make a serious move in the Western Conference even if it had been healthy. Second-year head coach Will Hardy made an investment by handing the point guard keys to George, who came out of Baylor as primarily a shooting guard. Whether George will be the long-term point guard remains to be seen, but Hardy‚Äôs decision to let the offense run through the 20-year-old will assuredly make him a more determined playmaker moving forward, regardless of which position he ends up occupying.Before the season, the Jazz rolled the dice on Collins, acquiring him via trade, in the hope they could rebuild some of his value after he‚Äôd grown replaceable inAtlanta. While Collins would often struggle defensively, he did get a chance to be featured more in the offense, while boosting his rebounding numbers for the first time in years. Whether the Jazz showcased him enough to make other teams interested in his services remains to be seen, but the remaining $53.1 million on his contract is sure to prove problematic.A broader discussion needs to take place within the front office this summer. Due to Markkanen‚Äôs modest compensation of just over $18 million, Utah will find it impossible to extend him outright due to the NBA‚Äôs 140% extension limit on veteran contracts. To retain Markkanen long-term, the Jazz will need to renegotiate his contract and use cap space to hand him a significant raise.This might appear as the logical next step, however, Markkanen turns 27 in May, and the team is nowhere close to being good enough to compete in the playoffs. Keeping Markkanen long term presents a series of overarching questions about the state of the franchise, which direction to go in, and whether it makes sense to spend the next two to three years waiting for George,Brice Sensabaugh,Walker KesslerandTaylor Hendricksto improve to a level where they can make a real run ‚Äî if they even can.In many ways, Utah‚Äôs decision to lean into youth this season was puzzling given how committed the Jazz seem to be to Markkanen, which is going to make this summer all the more intriguing.Their biggest need will be determined by which direction they wish to go. If the Jazz have intentions of being competitive next season, they will need an actual veteran point guard who can lead the offense. If they‚Äôre rebuilding, they won‚Äôt have specific needs, looking instead to acquire young players and draft assets to eventually get back to relevance.Jazz CEO Danny Aingetold reporters at the conclusion of the seasonthat Keyonte George isn't the franchise point guard they're looking for. ""I'm still not sure he's a franchise point guard. I think he can play point guard, but I think that he can play with another guard playing the point and he can play off the ball."" The Jazz have two first-round picks and an early second-round pick and could be targeting playmakers like Kentucky'sRob DillinghamandReed Sheppardor Serbia's Nikola Topiƒá, or draft some size alongside Walker Kessler in Purdue starZach Edey, Kel'el Ware ofIndianaorOso Ighodaroof Marquette.‚Äî Krysten PeekProjected draft picks (pre-lottery):Nos. 8, 9 and 32Should Utah relinquish the rights to bothTalen Horton-TuckerandKira Lewis Jr., which isn‚Äôt out of the realm of possibility, they could enter the summer with well over $30 million in cap space. Should they find a taker for Collins that would be willing to absorb a significant portion of his salary into cap space, even more money will be freed up.What that money should be spent on falls into one of two lines of thinking. The Jazz could look to make upgrades by being aggressive on the free agent market and hope to re-sign Markkanen in 2025, or they could take care of the Finnish forward this summer, forgoing upgrades and signing their All-Star to a near-max deal as they use the available cap space to renegotiate his deal.Financially, the Jazz find themselves in a good spot. Their books are generally clean and they don‚Äôt have a single dollar committed beyond the 2025-26 season, meaning they can go in whichever direction they choose with several options at hand.Key free agents:Talen Horton-Tucker (UFA)Picking a direction and sticking to it. No one would bat an eye at the Jazz for looking at the strength of the current Western Conference and coming to the conclusion they might as well sit this one out for a few years while they tinker with their roster. With the Grizzlies coming back into the picture next season, and with the Spurs likely also making moves to get better, taking a long-term approach wouldn‚Äôt be a bad decision.Invest in their youth movement. The Jazz have draft picks for days and ample cap space to use in the years ahead to form a competitive roster. I expect Ainge to find new homes for Collins and possiblyJordan Clarksonand Sexton, which could open up minutes for Kessler, Hendricks, Sensabaugh and George.‚Äî Dan TitusWith no draft picks this summer, and Nic Claxton becoming an unrestricted free agent, things look bleak in Brooklyn.Jake Fischer and Dan Devine discuss the Knicks taking a 2-0 lead over the Pacers, the Hornets hiring a new head coach and some big questions for the Bucks, 76ers, Clippers & Magic.The No. 1 pick in the 2024 WNBA Draft is set for her preseason finale tonight.Tara VanDerveer retired last month as the winningest head coach in men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs Division-I college basketball.Jalen Brunson is considered questionable for Friday‚Äôs game in Indianapolis.Former NBA player Glen Davis was sentenced to 40 months in prison after his conviction for being involved in a scheme to defraud the league's healthcare plan.Frank Vogel's out after one season in Phoenix failed to produce a playoff win.It‚Äôs unclear if the wager will actually hold up under the league‚Äôs gambling policy.A disappointing April led Carroll and his Diamondbacks coaches to reexamine his swing mechanics and get back to his strengths.As modern media becomes more niche driven, teams and even leagues have to balance whether to seek the biggest TV contracts or the biggest potential audience.The pair has been a perfect fit on the court, but it‚Äôs away from the game where the dynamic duo‚Äôs friendship was really forged.As part of a new proposal, power conference leaders are considering reducing football rosters from more than 115 to as few as 85 players.Indiana's head coach refused to blame the officiating following Game 1, then looked at the high road two days later and went a step away from nuclear.Keefe took over from Mike Babcock in November 2019.Nikola Jokiƒá joins a short list of the game's all-time greats after securing his third MVP.Teams have made their big splashes in free agency and made their draft picks, it's time for you to do the same.

Those disputed plays were then submitted to the league. The Pacers chose not to sendanything in after Game 1because Carlisle was hoping to get ""a more balanced whistle"" in Game 2. They feel they did not, and changed their minds.""I can promise you that we're going to submit these tonight,"" Carlisle said after Game 2. ""New York can get ready. They'll see 'em too. I'm always talking to our guys about not making it about the officials, but we deserve a fair shot.""Per Windhorst, the plays in question will also be sent to the Knicks as part of league protocol.Akick ball violationonAaron Nesmithand a moving screen call late in the fourth quarter drew Carlisle's ire after Game 1. In Game 2, officials reversed a double-dribble violation on Knicks centerIsaiah Hartensteinthat could have given Indiana a key late possession.During his post-Game 2 session with the media, Carlisle played the small-market card, saying that the Pacers are at a disadvantage playing against a team like the Knicks.""Small-market teams deserve an equal shot,"" Carlisle said. ""They deserve a fair shot no matter where they're playing.""Pacers players, however, weren't going down the same road as their coach when talking about officiating and why they're down 2-0 in the series.""Let's not pretend like [officiating] is the only reason we lost; we just didn't play good enough,"" said forwardTyrese Haliburton. ""We just got to be better.""""We love Rick showing that type of energy on the court,""said guard T.J. McConnell via the Indy Star. ""It's unfortunate that he got ejected, but that's not the feeling we have in the locker room. We're not gonna sit here and blame officials. We gotta be better. It's just that simple. They smashed us on the boards again tonight and just brought more energy than we did. We gotta fix that.""What didn't help the Pacers in Game 2 was their shooting. They shot 51.6% from the floor, 44.1% from the 3-point line and 58.8% from the foul line.

But with three Knicks already averaging more than 41 minutes per game in the postseason, and against an Indiana team that goes nine-deep and bothplaysandgets shots upfaster than any team in the NBA, each successive removal of a building block seemed to pose a greater threat to the structural integrity of Thibs‚Äô Jenga tower. At what point would the Knicks finally lose one piece too many, sending the franchise‚Äôs best season in nearly a quarter-century crashing down?For about 15 and a half heart-stopping minutes of game time during Wednesday‚Äôs Game 2, it seemed like we‚Äôd found our answer.Here‚Äôs my best guess of whenJalen Brunsontweaked his right foot. He immediately demanded a sub.pic.twitter.com/Wxe6ZWW3oT‚Äî Scott Agness (@ScottAgness)May 9, 2024With just under four minutes to go in the first quarter, Jalen Brunson closed out on aT.J. McConnelldrive and promptly developed a bit of a hitch in his giddyup. After anObi Toppin3-pointer and the ensuing inbounds pass, Brunson looked over at the Knicks bench and waved for a substitution. This struck Thibodeau as rare.‚ÄúYeah, well, the thing about Jalen: He never asks out of a game,‚Äù Thibodeau said. ‚ÄúSo, you know, I knew that there was something.‚ÄùThat something took Brunson ‚Äî the fifth-place finisher in2024 NBA MVP voting, theleading scorerin the 2024 NBA playoffs, the first player in NBA history to score 40-plus points and dish five or more assists infour consecutive postseason games‚Äî off the Knicks bench and back to the locker room for the balance of the first quarter. A few minutes later, his father, Knicks assistant coach Rick Brunson, also departed the bench.The radio silence inside Madison Square Garden was deafening.‚ÄúAnd then, when he didn't come back, you know, you just wait to hear from medical, what they say,‚Äù Thibodeau said.What they said made an awful lot of hearts sink:sore right foot, questionable to return. The one guy the Knicks can‚Äôt afford to lose ‚Äî the one who, during the regular season, wasthe differencebetween New York scoring like the NBA‚Äôs second-best offense and its absolute worst ‚Äî was now in danger of being lost.So, by the way, wasthe game.The Knicks actually continued to score at a super-efficient clip without Brunson ‚Äî redirecting more play-initiating responsibility againstIndiana‚Äôs full-court pressure toJosh HartandDonte DiVincenzo, running more of their half-court offense through centerIsaiah Hartensteinin dribble handoff actions and benefiting from the most aggressive offensive performance ofOG Anunoby‚Äôs four-month tenure in Manhattan.The more pressing issues, though, came on the other end. Indiana‚Äôs relentless commitment to cranking up the tempo ‚Äî pushing the ball down the floor off missed shots, made shots, turnovers and just about anything else that can happen on a basketball court ‚Äî left the Knicks looking positively adrift:With All-Star point guardTyrese Haliburtonputting his imprint on the proceedings by delivering apromised uptick in offensive aggressionafter a comparatively sedate Game 1, the Pacers scored 37 points on 22 second-quarter possessions against New York ‚Äî a blistering168.2 offensive rating for the stanza, with 11 assists on 15 made baskets, just one turnover and six 3-pointers ‚Äî allowing the visitors to take a 73-63 lead into intermission.While the Knicks were struggling trying to get a handle on the Pacers‚Äô go-go offense in that second quarter, Brunson was with New York‚Äôs training staff, trying to get a handle on whether he could go at all.Some Knicks didn‚Äôt know if they‚Äôd get him back.‚ÄúWe were going in thinking that we weren‚Äôt,‚Äù Hartenstein said.They prepared as if they wouldn‚Äôt have him.‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what we were down at halftime, but we‚Äôre in the locker room like, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre going to win this game, still,‚Äô‚Äù DiVincenzo said. ‚Äú‚ÄòWe‚Äôve got to defend, we‚Äôve got to rebound, limit their second chances, and then play our offense, not get outside of ourselves.‚Äô‚ÄùStill, though: They held out hope.‚ÄúI know that if he can go, he's going to go,‚Äù Thibodeau said. ‚ÄúThat's who he is.‚Äù‚ÄúAll season long, no matter what is thrown at him, injury bug or whatever, he always bounces back,‚Äù DiVincenzo said. ‚ÄúWe knew the severity of the game and everything, so everybody knew he was coming back.‚Äù‚ÄúI had a decision to make,‚Äù Brunson said. ‚ÄúAnd I made a decision.‚ÄùJalen Brunson just walked out of the tunnel and onto the court.

(Brunson later acknowledged thathe‚Äôd already fielded some jokesfrom teammates about the coincidence.)As he began to push off and change directions, though, Brunson was thinking less about Knicks history and more about current events.‚ÄúI just knew I had to get my mind in the right place to figure out how I was going to attack the second half,‚Äù he said.After a few dip-your-toe-in-the-water possessions where he operated off the ball, Brunson settled on a plan of attack: Take their heads off.‚ÄúWhen he‚Äôs out there, there‚Äôs a level of calmness ‚Äî a level of, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôll get the right shot, every single time,‚Äô‚Äù DiVincenzo said.When the Pacers shaded extra help his way or tried to blitz the ball out of his hands, he just calmly hit his release-valve outlet ‚Äî primarily Hartenstein or Hart ‚Äî and trusted them to make the next pass or play to keep the possession humming:‚ÄúI'm sure Jalen has seen that coverage a thousand times, so they really know what to do,‚Äù McConnell said. ‚ÄúThey cut and they get it to the guys that they need to, and they made shots out of it.‚ÄùAnd when they played Brunson straight up ‚Äî primarily withAndrew Nembhard, but really with anybody besides McConnell, who‚Äôs been sensational on both ends through two games ‚Äî he just torched them with the shot-making that‚Äôs turned him into one of the most dangerous scorers in the sport:Brunson joined Hart and DiVincenzo in playing the entire second half on that sore right foot, scoring a point per minute ‚Äî 24 of his team-high 29 points, on 9-for-16 shooting. If he doesn‚Äôt come back, this series is probably headed back to Indiana tied at one. But he did.So it‚Äôs not.‚ÄúThe mental toughness piece is so important,‚Äù Thibodeau said. ‚ÄúThe ability to get through things. To be at your best when your best is needed, even when you may not be feeling your best. That's who he is. He‚Äôs a great leader.‚ÄùThat leadership might be about to face another test. After scoring 28 points in 28 minutes, Anunoby left the game with 3:27 to go in the third quarter afterappearing to injure his left leg on a fast break. The Knicks later ruled him out for the rest of the contest with asore left hamstring.Thibodeau didn‚Äôt have an update on Anunoby‚Äôs status when he met with reporters after the game. If he‚Äôs unable to go in time for Friday‚Äôs Game 3, Thibodeau will be down tosixplayers he trusts, plus the possibility of a couple of minutes forAlec Burks.Hart has now played every second of the last 10 quarters the Knicks have played and has gone the distance in four of New York‚Äôs eight postseason games. Asked what would change if Anunoby‚Äôs unavailable for Game 3, the ever-quotable Hart replied, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm playing 48 anyway, dog. Ain‚Äôt s*** change.‚ÄùJosh Hart is the first player to play an entire playoff game four times in a postseason sinceJimmy Butlerin 2013.Tom Thibodeau was the coach in both situations üòÇ(h/t@SportsCenter)pic.twitter.com/5hvpgDrZMA‚Äî Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports)May 9, 2024DiVincenzo has averaged 45.1 minutes per game over the last three games, shouldering a greater complementary shot creation workload while also guarding All-Star Tyreses (firstMaxey, now Haliburton) the length of the floor. Brunson was averaging just under 44 minutes per game in the playoffs before Wednesday and played the final 24 straight on an injured foot.And yet: It‚Äôs the Knicks who are dominating theoffensive glass in the second half. It‚Äôs the Knicks who are tightening up defensively, allowing nearly 14 fewer points per 100 possessions in thesecond halfthan they havein the first. It‚Äôs the Knicks who consistently seem to hit first, second and third, and to come away with the loose ball or extra possession they need, exactly when they need it, even when they‚Äôre supposed to be exhausted.‚ÄúHonestly, it's just the willpower. It seems like they really just wanted it more tonight,‚Äù said McConnell, who termed it ‚Äúfrustrating‚Äù to see such a tightly curtailed rotation in which everyone‚Äôs playing so many minutes still manage to be the aggressor late.‚ÄúWe just have to try to continue to make things tough on them and get them to exert as much energy as possible,‚Äù he said.Eventually, that has to matter. Eventually, whatever deposits the Pacers can put into the legs of the Knicks will pay dividends, because even tough guys get tired. Eventually, even warriors lose the war of attrition.Until then, though: You give everything that you have. That‚Äôs all you can ask of a player. And you can win a lot of games that way.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a blueprint here that Thibs has laid out,‚Äù DiVincenzo said. ‚ÄúAnd no matter who is on the court, everybody follows that, and doesn‚Äôt go outside of themselves. No matter who‚Äôs in the game, we know what we‚Äôre looking to get. Any game that we play ‚Äî as long as we defend and we rebound and we have low turnovers, we can win any game.‚ÄùThis is who the Knicks are; this is what they believe, and they‚Äôll keep believing it until proven otherwise. The Pacers haven‚Äôt been able to dissuade them yet. Neither have the laws of biology, physiology or common sense. After all: What kind of sway does science have over a team that findsthe magic in the work?‚ÄúObviously, we wish we were healthy,‚Äù Hart said during a postgame interview on MSG. ‚ÄúBut when one guy goes down, man, someone else steps up. And we‚Äôve got more than what we need.‚ÄùJalen Brunson briefly went down with a foot injury in the first half on Wednesday night, and then returned to power the Knicks to a 2-0 series lead.Robinson had surgery on the ankle in December and missed 50 regular-season games.The Knicks have been more aggressive utilizing challenges early in games, and they led the league in total challenges and successful challenges during the first round of the NBA playoffs.It was Brunson's third straight 40-point game.Brunson scored 47 points and had 10 assists ‚Äî breaking Bernard King‚Äôs franchise record for playoff points that has stood since the spring of 1984 ‚Äî as the Knicks took control of the series.Jake Fischer and Dan Devine discuss the Knicks taking a 2-0 lead over the Pacers, the Hornets hiring a new head coach and some big questions for the Bucks, 76ers, Clippers & Magic.The Pacers identified 29 plays from Game 1 and 49 plays from Game 2 they did not agree with.Beverley has since said about both incidents, ""I have to be better.
